                <br>
                One can define an algorithm to be any well-defined computational procedure that takes some
                values as input and produces some values as output. Like a cooking recipe, an algorithm provides a
                step-by-step
                method for solving a computational problem. Unlike programs, algorithms are not dependent on a
                particular
                programming language, machine, system, or compiler. They are mathematical entities, which can be thought
                of
                as running on some sort of idealized computer with an infinite random access memory and an unlimited
                word
                size. Algorithm design is all about the mathematical theory behind the design of good programs.</p>

                <span class="paragraphTitle">Why study algorithm design? </span>
                <br>
                Programming is a very complex task, and there are a number of
                aspects of programming that make it so complex. The first is that most programming projects are
                very large, requiring the coordinated efforts of many people.
                (This is the topic a course like software engineering.) The next is that many
                programming projects involve storing and accessing large quantities of data efficiently. (This is the
                topic of
                courses on data structures and databases.) The last is that many programming projects involve solving
                complex
                computational problems, for which simplistic or naive solutions may not be efficient enough. The complex
                problems may involve numerical data (the subject of courses on numerical analysis), but often they
                involve
                discrete data. This is where the topic of algorithm design and analysis is important.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the algorithms discussed in this course will often represent only a tiny fraction of the code
                that is
                generated in a large software system, this small fraction may be very important for the success of the
                overall
                project. An unfortunately common approach to this problem is to first design an inefficient algorithm
                and
                data structure to solve the problem, and then take this poor design and attempt to fine-tune its
                performance. The
                problem is that if the underlying design is bad, then often no amount of fine-tuning is going to make a
                substantial
                difference.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The focus of this course is on how to design good algorithms, and how to analyze their efficiency. This
                is among
                the most basic aspects of good programming.

                <span class="paragraphTitle">Issues in Algorithm Design: </span>
                <br>
                Algorithms are mathematical objects (in contrast to the must more concrete notion of
                a computer program implemented in some programming language and executing on some machine). As such,
                we can reason about the properties of algorithms mathematically. When designing an algorithm there are
                two
                fundamental issues to be considered: <span class="paragraphTitle">correctness</span> and <span
                    class="paragraphTitle">efficiency</span>.
